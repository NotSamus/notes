## Notes



## Questions to answer
1. What is a quantum Repeater?

2. How does it not violate the no-cloning theorem?


3. Is this similar to the repeater we have in fiber optics?

4. Quantum-Classical Coexistence?

## Thoughts
1. so then quantum repeater are used to make the length of the transmission larger because light looses power.
